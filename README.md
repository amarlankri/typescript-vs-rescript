# typescript-vs-rescript

Small use cases written in TypeScript and ReScript.

## Compile ReScript

```sh
    npm run bsb
    npm run bsb:watch # watch mode
```

## Compile TypeScript

```sh
    npm run tsc
    npm run tsc:watch # watch mode
```

You can just call the JavaScript files emitted by the compiler using `node`.
- For ReScript, the generated files are located in `lib/js/src`.
- For TypeScript, the generated files are located in `lib-ts`.
